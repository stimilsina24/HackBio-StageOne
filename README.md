My submission(as part of Team Phenylalanine) for Stage 1 of HackBio internship. 

In this stage, I wrote my own python function to perform hamming distance between 2 strings and translating protein. 

Furthermore, I wrote python code to replicate some basic figure panels from a paper(scatterplot, volcano plot, correlation matrix, and heatmap).
